NUSMods has been an incredibly useful platform for NUS students, providing a user-friendly interface for planning their timetables and searching through the available modules. However, it does more than just that! Here are some of the lesser known features in NUSMods that can improve your productivity and make you even more productive!

## Lesson Theme Colors and Dark Mode

One of the most popular features of NUSMods is the colorful timetable lesson slots, as it gives colour to one's school life (literally). Do you know that there are a grand total of 32 different color themes for these lesson slots? They can be accessed via the [**Preferences**](https://nusmods.com/preferences) page or simply pressing the <kbd>←</kbd> and <kbd>→</kbd> arrow keys to switch between themes. Our personal favourites are the *Mocha*, *Monokai* and *Ocean* themes. There is even an [NUSWhispers](https://nuswhispers.com) theme if you can't get enough of it (;

Additionally, **Dark mode** is also available and can be activated by pressing <kbd>X</kbd>.

## CORS Bidding History

When bidding for modules, it may be a good idea to know how many points are required historically in order to obtain that module. One way to do this is to refer to the [CORS Archives](http://www.cors.nus.edu.sg/archive.html) page where they display the bidding points required for each module per round per semester. What good is that?! It's more common to compare the winning bid points for a particular module across rounds and semesters. And that's exactly what we built in. Simply go to any module page and scroll to the **CORS Bidding History** section. Read up more about how to utilize the CORS Bidding History [here](/how-nusmods-can-help-you-during-cors-bidding).

## Bookmark Modules

During the planning and bidding period, we may want keep a few modules in mind which we can use as back up modules in case we fail to obtain some modules. The bookmarking feature will come in handy in such situations. Simply click on the blue **Bookmark** button on the module page or the module finder page to add the module to your bookmarks. Your bookmarked modules can be accessed via the bookmark
icon in the navigation bar beside the search field.

## Venue Information and Availability

Sometimes it may be helpful to know what lessons are going on in a particular venue or to find empty venues to crash when you have a large block of free time. The [**Venues**](https://nusmods.com/venues) page will come in really helpful. With the **Venue Lookup** feature, you can retrieve a venue's weekly occupancy timetable. To find empty venues to crash, enter the desired day, start time and end time into the [**Venue Availability**](https://nusmods.com/venueavailability) page and a list of available venues that are empty during the specified time period will be shown.

## Navigation Shortcuts for Power Users

As programmers, we frequently use keyboard shortcuts to navigate around the various interfaces in a computer. Hence, we also built that functionality into NUSMods! Press <kbd>T</kbd> to jump to the [**Timetable**](https://nusmods.com/timetable) page, <kbd>M</kbd> to jump to the [**Module Finder**](https://nusmods.com/modules) page, <kbd>V</kbd> to jump to the [**Venues**](https://nusmods.com/venueavailability) page, and many more! Full list of shortcuts can be found on the [**Help**](https://nusmods.com/help) page.

We hope that you have found some of the above tips useful for increasing your productivity. All the best for the new academic year! (:
